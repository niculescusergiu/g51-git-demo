I've just watched the Scrum tutorial and it seems as if it is a very useful method, 
redefining the waterflow method that lets you structure up your work and keep track of exactly everything 
that has been done or that needs doing, stepwise so that a group can see and pick up anything that isn't finished 
or to identify the most important tasks that are prioritized and could just continue where the other team member 
finished or maybe pick up a new task from the project backlog. The biggest difference inbetween the waterflow method
 and SCRUM is that the scrum method is much quicker oftenly consisting of only 1-4 weeks of planning and working, 
having micro-releases every now and then, while the waterflow method has a long period of maybe 3-6  
months where you are planning, building and testing for the majority of time and only one major release. 
SCRUM allows us to work faster and more efficient, meeting deadlines more frequent which doesn't let us fall behind.
