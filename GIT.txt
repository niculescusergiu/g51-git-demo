Version Control System

- Known as source control or revision control tool
- To track and manage changes made to a set of files
- Types of version control systems: Git, Subversion, Mercurius etc.

Easier to figure out what went wrong and who made changes in the files you're working with
VCS will make a log file where it records changes with an unique ID.
If changes/mistakes have been made, we can check the logfile and make a rollback to a earlier working version.

Who made the change?
Why was the change made and when was it made?


What is Git?

- Open Source VCS
- To store source codes in the special storage called Repository
-To track and view code history
- To compare and revert changes
- To make it easier for developers to collaborate
- GUY clients & Command Prompt

For developers its simple to use the command prompt for a deeper understanding of the Git functionalities

Why Git?

- Distributed VCS
- Easy collaboration
- Tracking changes
- Rollback to previous versions
- Branching and merging
- Speed and performance

Git Repository

- Centralized location for all files, directories, & history of projects (projects folders)
- Primary types of repositories: Local repository & Remote repository
- To have a Git repository:
 - Creating a New Repository
 - Cloning an existing repository

The local repository is represented by Git, meanwhile the remote repository is on Github

How to get started with Git

1. Download and install Git
2. Configure Git
 - Open a terminal or cmd
 - Configure your name and email address using the following commands:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

Basic Git Operations

git init - Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory
git add  - Adds a specific file or all files and changes to the staging area
git commit - Records changes to the repository
git status - Shows the status of the working directory and staging area
git log - Displays the commit history
git clone - Creates a local copy of a remote repository on your machine
git pull - Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository in the current brach
git push - Pushes local commits to a remote repository on the specified branch


What is GitHub?

- Hosting service for Git repositories
- Hosting platform for collaboration and version control
- Is a location where all the version control fiels are stored
- Offers private and public repositories
- Sign up and host a public code repository for free

Why GitHub?

- Centralizerd Remote Repository Hosting
- Collaboration and teamwork
- Version control and history
-  Visibility and showcase
